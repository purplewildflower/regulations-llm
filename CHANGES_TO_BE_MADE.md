We learned that...
    * the real data is not the same as fake data.
      * real data abstracts do not necessarily explain what the docket is about
      * the content.htm (website extract) always explains the docket, but this can be very long
      * we probably need to summarize this entire content.htm and find various things:
        * is it new regulation
        * are we eliminating regulations
        * what are the relevant laws
        * is this proposed or final
        * what are the timelines
      * therefore keyword extraction will be difficult.
      * we might want to reduce the set size of the keywords
        * dimensionality reduction
    * classification

Classes of keywords?
    * what is it
    * agency
    * theme 
    * location
  
* add ability to add agency name and reduce the size of data taken
